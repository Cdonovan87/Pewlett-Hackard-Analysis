# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
For this challenge I was tasked with using sql to determine  the total number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees who are eligible for a mentorship program. I was givien this task to prepare the client for the "silver tsunami" that is to come for their company when employees reach retirement age.
## Results
* Based on the retiring titles table the clients company will see the majority of potential retirement eligible employees be in the senior engineer, 29414 employees, and senior staff, 28255 employees. 
* The titles with the least amount of retirement eligible employees are assistant engineer with 1761 employees and manager with 2.
* There is a total of 1549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.
## Summary
* Based off the retiring titles tabel it is estimated that around 90,398 will eventually have to be replaced due to the incoming "silver tsunami".
* As mentioned above there are around a total of 1549  eligible employees to help with a mentorship program for the company, i do not believe that this is enough that will allow the company to prepare a decent amount of future employees to be ready for the incominc "tsunami" of retirees. Based off the total employees table wich says that there are a total of 300,024 employees. this means that once the tsunami fully hits the number should theoretically be at 209,626 employees.Because of this I believe there will be enough employees to help replace the soon to be retirees but I do not believe enough of them will have been well prepared by the mentorship program to fully replace them.
